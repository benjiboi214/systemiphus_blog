    description: `Currently working as a Solution Architect for LivePerson APAC. 
    I've been working in technology to various capacities for the last 8 years, but more focused on programming/engineering since joining LivePerson in 2017.
    I love tackling new problems, understanding them and revel in the opportunity to help others benefit from any time and effort already expended.`,
    subDescription: `The name Systemiphus is a combination of the systems I work with day after day and the greek legend of Sysiphus.
    I had high hopes for this name as a business name and ultimately a consulting brand... 
    However, the first time I tried to spell it out over the phone in the form of an email address, I quickly realised my error.
    It's now relegated to the name of a blog that I never expect anyone to read.`,
